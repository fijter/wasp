# ISCP Architecture

With ISCP anyone can start their own chain and define the validators.

Each chain has its own state where a state update (going from one block to the next) is hashed and published to the tangle, which moves the state anchor on Layer 1.

The multi-chain nature of ISCP makes it a more complex implementation of smart contracts over say Ethereum as illustrated here:
