# ISCP Documentation

Goal of the documentation: Give a higher level overview of what ISCP is and how it works for the average developer building applications for ISCP or looking to run a chain/node. Doesnâ€™t need to contain every explicit detail but should contain everything you need to know to set up a smart contract chain and run and interact with smart contracts.

## ISCP Core Concepts

- [What Are Smart Contracts?](/docs/guide/core_concepts/smart-contracts)
- [What is ISCP?](/docs/guide/core_concepts/iscp)
- [ISCP Architecture Overview](/docs/guide/core_concepts/iscp-architecture)
- [Committees and Validators](/docs/guide/core_concepts/validators)
- [Consensus](/docs/guide/core_concepts/consensus)
- [State, Transitions and State Anchoring](/docs/guide/core_concepts/states)
- Accounts
    - [How Accounts Work](/docs/guide/core_concepts/accounts/how-accounts-work)
    - [How to Deposit to a Chain](/docs/guide/core_concepts/accounts/how-to-deposit-to-a-chain)
    - [How to Withdraw From a Chain](/docs/guide/core_concepts/accounts/how-to-withdraw-from-a-chain)
- Interacting With Smart Contracts
    - [On-ledger Requests](/docs/guide/core_concepts/smartcontract-interaction/on-ledger-requests)
    - [Off-ledger Requests](/docs/guide/core_concepts/smartcontract-interaction/on-ledger-requests)
